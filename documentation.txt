OPTIONS
   MAIN OPTIONS
      -a AMOUNT, --add AMOUNT
         Add a financial record of AMOUNT to the budget history. AMOUNT is expressed as a signed integer or float with no greater than two places past the decimal. A '+' or '-' may preface the amount to denote sign; if not given, AMOUNT will be assumed to be negative. A command line invocation of ttybudget may contain an arbitrary number of add commands.
      -p, --print
         Print financial records to stdout and exit. When no print options are specified, print all financial records. The date format can be specified using the --iso or --us options.
      -h, --help 
         Display usage info and exit
      -v, --version 
         Display version info and exit

   ADD OPTIONS
      -t TAG_A,TAG_B, ..., --tags TAG_A,TAG_B, ...
         Specify one or more searchable tags associated with the added financial record. Tags are specified in a comma-delimited list, with no spaces between. If not used, no tag is associated with the record. A record can contain no more than 8 tags.
      -m "MESSAGE", --message "MESSAGE"
         Specify a message associated with the added financial record. MESSAGE is enclosed in double quotation marks and has a maximum length of 256 characters. If not used, no message is associated with the record.
      -d DATE, --date DATE
         Specify a date associated with the added financial record. The date at which the record is added is otherwise associated with it by default. The date format can be specified using the date format options.

   PRINT OPTIONS
      -q TAG_A,TAG_B,..., --query-tags TAG_A,TAG_B,...
         Only print financial records that are associated with the specified tag(s). Tags are specified using the same format as with the -t option.
      -i BOUND1 [BOUND2], --interval BOUND1 [BOUND2]
         Only print financial records that occur between BOUND1 and BOUND2. Both bounds are specified using the set date format, as with the -d option and are inclusive (e.g., if BOUND1 is 2021-06-4, records on that date are included). If only BOUND1 is specified, only financial records that occured on the date of BOUND1 are displayed.
      -r BOUND1 [BOUND2], --range BOUND1 [BOUND2]
         Only print financial records whose amounts fall between BOUND1 and BOUND2. Bounds are specified as signed integers or floats with two places past the decimal. If BOUND2 is not specified, only records whose amounts match BOUND1 will be displayed. 
      -s, --sort
         Rather than printing financial records in chronological order, sort and print records from highest to lowest amounts.

   DATE FORMAT OPTIONS
      --iso
         ISO 6801 is the default date format, and can be entered using slashes (YYYY/MM/DD), dashes (YYYY-MM-DD), or no delimiters at all (YYYYMMDD).
      --us
         Specifies US date format (MM/DD/YYYY). The same rules regarding slashes, dashes, or no delimiters as with iso format apply.
      --long
         Specifies long date format, separated by spaces (DD Month YYYY).

   CONFIG OPTIONS
      --base-dir BASE_DIRECTORY
         Specifies a new path to where the financial records are stored (default /home/<LOGIN>/.local/share/ttybudget).
      --currency CURRENCY_CHARACTER
         Specifies a new character to denote currency (default '$').
      --date-format DATE_FORMAT
         Specifies the default date format (initial default is "iso"). Accepts "iso" or "us" as arguments.
      --use-file RECORDS_FILE
         Specifies a records file to read from and write to for the current invocation only, as opposed to the one contained in the default directory (see --base-dir)_.
